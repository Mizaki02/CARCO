		The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond"The Toyota Supra MK4 - is equipped with a twin-turbo 3.0-litre straight-six engine, producing up to 320 hp and around 440 Nm of torque, known as the 2JZ-series.

It has a 2+2 seating layout and is considered both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It succeeds the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The car is built on the PM platform, derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Production is conducted in a shared production line at Nissan's Tochigi plant in Japan.</b>
		<br><br>
		A supercar as iconic as the GT-R entails maintaining a legendary status. That means enhanced aerodynamics with new front and rear fascias for added downforce without increasing drag. Once again, the GT-R redefines the excitement of driving a supercar.

		The V-Spec (short for Victory Specification) features several upgrades over the standard R34 GT-R, including a stiffer suspension, larger brakes, and a number of aerodynamic enhancements such as a carbon fiber front splitter and rear spoiler.

		Lamborghini’s years-long motorsport know-how, intensified by a winning heritage, is concentrated in the new Huracán STO. Its extreme aerodynamics, track-honed handling dynamics, lightweight contents and the highest-performing V10 engine to date come together, ready to trigger all the emotions of the racetrack in your everyday life.</b>
		<br><br>
		The interior features the same track-minded approach, using lightweight, high-quality materials throughout—most notably carbon fiber. 	Featured in the door panels, interior details, seats and floor mats, this innovative and distinctive material offers a super-sports look that perfectly complements the car’s fine Alcantara® and Carbon Skin® finishes for added performance flair and functional style. 
		While recalling the Huracán EVO, the interior solutions of the new Huracán STO contribute to an overall weight reduction compared to the previous model. Along with additional features such as a new trim and titanium roll bar with 4-point seatbelts**, the end result elicits the sensation and character of true racing from the moment you get behind the wheel.</p>

Without going into too much detail, it probably comes as no surprise that throughout shooting, more than one of these Minis were used. Also, some parts of the original orange Mini were transferred to one of these newer green models, namely the steering wheel cover, seats and carpet.</b>
		<br><br>
		Mr. Bean’s Mini has become one of the most recognisable cars in pop culture. Put it into a line-up with other cars and everyone would likely be able to guess who it belongs to. They would also probably be able to recall a time when they laughed hysterically at the hijinks that Mr. Bean committed with his car. And with that kind of recognition, history and character, who knows, we might not have seen the last of this little Mini on the screen.

The Huracán Performante has reworked the concept of super sports cars and taken the notion of performance to levels never seen before. The vehicle has been re-engineered in its entirety, as regards its weight, engine power, chassis and above all by introducing an innovative system of active aerodynamics: ALA. The use of the awarded Forged Composites®, a shapable forged carbon fiber material patented by Automobili Lamborghini, is a real nice touch and it contributes to make the vehicle even lighter in weight. Besides its extraordinary technological properties, it also conveys a new idea of beauty.
		</b>
		<br>
		All the new features of the Huracán Performante express performance. The front and rear spoilers, made entirely of Forged Composites®, enable the aerodynamics to be actively exploited to achieve maximum performance by increasing or decreasing the downforce as required. The new, even lighter wheel rims hold the new Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres, providing incredible grip.

		<b>The Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat  Price in Philippines available at <p style="text-decoration-line: underline;">₱5.78 Million</p>. where tires go to die. It’s one of the last coupes with American-style V-8 thunder under its hood. The Challenger SRT Hellcat lineup’s most reserved model spews 717 horsepower from its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine. But there’s so much more: output from the Hellcat Redeye model’s version of this engine jumps to 797 horsepower. And the meanest, nastiest Hellcat Redeye, the Widebody Jailbreak edition, deploys 807 horsepower. All Challenger SRT Hellcats help you toward a suspended license with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel-drive is the only configuration offered and is one that is always ready to deploy billows of smoke from each of its massive, 12-inch-wide rear tires. While souped-up rivals such as the Chevy Camaro ZL1 and Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 are more road-course friendly, the SRT Hellcat has surface-prepared drag strip energy. And a lot of it. The more everyday all-wheel drive, V-6, and smaller V-8 equipped Challenger are reviewed separately.</b><br><br>
		The Challenger interior was redesigned for the 2015 model year with a driver-centric layout, straightforward switchgear, and better materials. The SRT twins have standard leather finery, unique badging and gauge colors, and heated and ventilated front seats. Despite its roomy cabin, the plastics still look cheap, and visibility to the rear is poor.</p>
